Advantages of Pair Programming
There are several advantages to pair programming that our team experienced. The biggest advantage being that you did not constantly have to share a code to edit it and it updated each person code at the time it was happening. Instead of dividing up sections of the code for individuals to work on this allowed us all to do it at once. When it was obvious that a team member was struggling to complete a code, someone was able to jump in and help them. This allowed the code to be written easier because individuals with stronger coding abilities were able to talk the others through what was going wrong and what was needed to solve the error that was popping up. This not only got the assignment complete, but it also helped strengthen others coding abilities due to the joint effort. 

Disadvantage of Pair Programming 
Our only disadvantage to pair programming was we were only able to get it to work if we were all doing it at the same time. We were not able to start up the code and get it to function the way we intended if only one individual was trying to do it on their own. This meant we had to be sure and schedule times were we were all able to sit at our computers and work at it during a predetermined timeframe. This showed us how important it is to not to wait till the last minute to try and set up a day and time; allowing individuals to work there schedule around to allow time to finish the code.
